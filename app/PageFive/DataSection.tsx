            MLM Binary Plan is a multilevel marketing compensation plan which
            allows distributors to have only two front-line distributors. If a
            distributor sponsors more than two distributors, the excess are
            placed at levels below the sponsoring distributors front-line. This
            "Spillover Binary Plan" is one of the most attractive features to
            new distributors since they need only sponsor two distributors to
            participate in the compensation plan. The primary limitation is that
            distributors must "balance" their two down line legs to receive
            commissions. Balancing legs typically requires that the number of
            sales from one down line leg constitute no more than a specified
            percentage of the distributor&apos;s total sales.
